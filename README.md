PCe System
==========

Personal Cognitive Environment  
------------------------------

PCe (Personal Cognitive Environment) is the user-facing cognitive interface of the Umbra-Noesis ecosystem.  
It serves as the personalized environment where human intent, AI cognition, and interactive system components converge.

PCe is designed to provide:

- A consistent and intuitive user interaction layer  
- Personalized cognitive tooling  
- Real-time interface between user intent and EVAA cognition  
- Local-first operation with optional hybrid connectivity  
- Seamless integration with all Umbra-Noesis modules  

PCe is the “experience layer” of the ecosystem — where the user and the AI meet.

Purpose
-------

PCe exists to:

- Provide a structured, personalized environment for human–AI interaction  
- Translate user goals, tasks, and preferences into cognitive signals for EVAA  
- Present information, tools, and cognitive workflows in a coherent interface  
- Serve as the front-end for Umbra-Noesis OS and all local cognition modules  
- Enable adaptive behavior shaped by user intent and context  
- Support device interoperability through Umbra Link  

PCe represents the user’s individualized cognitive workspace.
